  <h2>22/07/23</h2>
  <h3>Motions</h3>
  <p>A motion is an application before the court to grant certain reliefs. It is an application before a court praying the court for certain reliefs or remedies. Carries two addresses yours and that for service. Plaintiff/ Defendant Applicant ~ Plaintiff/ Defendant Respondent.</p>
  <p>Types: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Substituted service</li>
    <li>Bail</li>
    <li>Injunction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A motion has three parts;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Motion paper: founding document for your affidavit. Would be dated, have the statutory authority.</li>
    <li>Affidavit:
      <ul>
        <li>Introductory part - I, name, sex, adult, religion, citizenship, nativity, profession, do hereby make oaths and state as follows i.e description of the individual.</li>
        <li>It is usually in numbered paragraphs.</li>

        <li>Jurat- s.119 evidence Act applies in the case where an illiterate is involved (an illiterate is someone who does not understand the language in which he is spoken to). This jurat is to show that the jurat has explained the content of the affidavit to the deponent and he/she has understood and signed afterward. The commissioner for oaths is the registrar.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Written Address: outlines the arguments</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Motion on Ex Parte/Interim Injunction:</strong> This is a motion given without the notice of the other party. It refrains from fair hearing and therefore it becomes unconstitutional. One must convince the court to grant this motion and after granting, it lasts for 7 days. It is done before any trial and during legal proceedings. Once it has been granted, it becomes a motion on notice after which the other party would defend themselves. This motion is given to stop a person from doing a particular thing or a specific act. This motion is granted due to the urgency of the res within which a motion on notice is granted. </p>
<p><strong>Montion on Notice/Interlocutory Injunction:</strong> The order given when a motion on notice is served and granted is called an interlocutory injunction and this lasts pending the determination of the substantive suit. Injunctions do not determine rights; if that should be then you would have to file a substantive suit, i.e., a main suit.</p>
<p><strong>Substamtive Suit/Pepertual Injunction:</strong> During the main suit, one can then request for a perpetual injunction which is in continuum.</p>
  <p>The statement given on the admissibility of various documents in between proceedings is a ruling. A motion is an <strong>originating motion</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Motion can be moved in terms or by outlining in details the different parts of the motion.</strong> Before you move a motion you must seek for leave of court to move that motion and the court must grant the leave before you go ahead. Moving in terms based on the terms of the motion paper...rely on your affidavit and adopt the written address.</p>

  <h2>Civil Proceeding</h2>
  <p><strong>Four Ways to Institute a Civil Action</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Writ of Summons: Used when the matter involves contentious issues, i.e., issues where facts are disputed.</li>
    <li>Originating Summons: This is used when the matter involves non-contentious issues, i.e., issues where facts are not disputed but issues of law.</li>
    <li>Originating Motions: Used for fundamental rights enforcement claims or to seek a particular relief in court.</li>
    <li>Petitions: Used to institute certain kinds of matters, dissolution of marriage, winding up of companies, electoral matters.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pleadings</h3>
  <p>Civil matters are fought basically on pleadings.</p>
  <p>The person who institutes a civil matter is the plaintiff while who it's against is the defendant.</p>
  <p>Reason why the court should not admit a case...Preliminary Objection. Defendant/Applicant</p>
  <p>Plaintiff/Respondent</p>
  <p>Statement of Claim is the first point of pleading for the applicant and the response to it is Statement of Defence. The plaintiff then replies to the statement of defence after which the defendant places a counter claim (at this point the burden of proof shifts to the defendant) and then the plaintiff replies to the counter claim.</p>

  <p>Things That Accompany Writ of Summons</p>
  <p><strong>Plaintiff</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writ of summons</li>
    <li>Statement of claim</li>
    <li>List of witnesses</li>
    <li>Written deposition</li>
    <li>List of documents</li>
    <li>Documents to be relied on</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Defendant</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Memorandum of appearance (conditional: appearing in protest /unconditional: full appearance)</li>
    <li>Statement of defence/counter claim</li>
    <li>List of witnesses</li>
    <li>Written deposition</li>
    <li>List of documents</li>
    <li>Documents to be relied on</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Civil Proceeding</h2>
  <p><strong>High Court Civil Procedure Rules of Imo State 2018</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Criminal Proceedings</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015</strong> and <strong>Administration of Criminal Justice Laws Imo State 2020</strong>.</p>
  <p>Duration to reply to a written address</p>

  <h2>Hearing</h2>
  <p>This is the substance of every matter or suit. It encompasses three processes Examination-in-chief, Cross Examination, and Re-examination.</p>
  <p>In civil processes, there is a thing called pre-trial conference. It is a mini-suit performed before the actual commencement of the main suit. It is done by filing a pre-trial information sheet with yes or no questions in order to hear from the clients about what actually caused the said matter and tries to limit the issues to a lesser number of issues, know the number of witnesses and the time allocated to each witness, set the modalities on how the matter would be proceeded afterward the matter goes into the hearing stage.</p>
  <p>Plea of liable & non-liable ~ plea bargain.</p>
